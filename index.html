		<h3>Caption</h3>
		<p>A random boquet \ Three hundred eccentric shapes \ Exploding in space.</p> <hr>
		<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
		<p>I used a very simple program to create colortris at completely random points with random color vertices. I weighted the values in such a way that they look like they're exploding from the top left corner. A bit of chaos to let off steam from the rigidity of building a rasterizer.</p> <hr>

		<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
		<p>To create this image, we fed a png into Geometrize (https://www.samcodes.co.uk/project/geometrize-haxe-web/) which converts our png into a svg composed of triangles. However, the svgparser included in this project only supports colors given in hex while Geometrize outputs colors in the format "rgb(r,g,b)" so we had to edit it in svgparser.cpp to allow support for this format.</p> <hr>

		<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
		<p>I made it with Adobe Illustrator. Illustrator will use <rect> instead of <polygon> for rectangles when generating svg files. robot.svg bypassed this by using two triangles to form a rectangle. I bypassed this by adding a new anchor point for each rectangle, so Illustrator thought itâ€™s actually a pentagon.</p> <hr>
		<h3>How long did it take?</h3>
		<p>~5 hours</p>

		<h3>Caption</h3>
		<p>We created an approximate version of the Shepp Logan Phantom. This phantom serves as a simplified model for a human brain and is widely used to test image reconstruction algorithms in the field of medical imaging.</p> <hr>
		<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
		<p>In order to create the figure, we needed to create ellipses. However, we do not have ellipses nor circles implemented in our SVG parser and rasterization. Therefore, we created our own unit circle polygon coordinates with 100 points using Python, and used this circle as our base shape to create the phantom. For each ellipse in the figure, we added scaling, rotation and translation, and use the respective color. In the pipeline, each circle polygon is converted to triangles that we then rasterize. Clearly, the number of points in the unit circle is a parameter that can be increased, but we saw decent results with 100 points.</p> <hr>
		<h3>How long did it take?</h3>
		<p>1-2 hours. Spent some time trying different approaches and getting the right proportions.</p>

		<h3>Caption</h3>
		<p>I didn't feel like exercising myself so Cubeman volunteered to do some jumping jacks for me!</p> <hr>
		<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
		<p>I built off of the transformations we implemented in the project and made 5 different svg files of cubeman in different positions. I also changed the colors to be a teal color. I used an online gif maker to stitch the 5 images together to create an animated gif.</p> <hr>
		<h3>How long did it take?</h3>
		<p>around 1-2 hours</p>
