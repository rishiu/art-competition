		<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
		<p>I modified the pipeline in a way such that it renders objects based on scaled coordinates of each vertex. The scale is updated in every frame to allow animations.</p> <hr>

		<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
		<p>I decided to use the sculpting tool within Blender to create a sitting bear! It took much patience and persistence, but using primarily the smoothing, inflating, scraping, flattening, layering, and elastic deform tool, I was able to turn a sphere into a bear! I did run into an issue of non-manifold vertices, but I was able to fix that through Blender's "Select All By Trait" tool. There were additional issues with rendering the .dae file within the Mesh Editor, but with the help of a fellow student on Piazza, I was able to change the Lambert shading to Phong shading and switch the triangles geometry to polylist with a vcount tag. I then took various screenshots of the subdivided bear in the MeshEditor, incrementally moving the bear. 20 screenshots later, I imported them into Photoshop and attempted to use some of the twelve basic principles of animation that we learned about in lecture and edited the background of the bear for each frame. Finally, I imported the frames into an online GIF maker and produced the final GIF!</p> <hr>

		<p>The Lonely Sink<br>
			<br>
			This sink has survived for many decades and gone through many hardships acting as a sink. </p> <hr>
		<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
		<p>1. Used a blender model. Extrude/scale/subdivide<br>
			2. Import to older version of blender and export back<br>
			3. Run on p2 code.<br>
			4. profit</p> <hr>
		<h3>How long did it take?</h3>
		<p>This blender model didn't take too long to make(10-30mins). I intially made a much larger blender model that I spent a few days on that rendered as(https://imgur.com/a/b9Usx2T),  but it didn't render on the p2 code.</p>

		<p>this is a snowman<br>
			not sure how to join meshes<br>
			don't forget to smile</p> <hr>
		<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
		<p>3 cubes upsampled a couple times, the meshes aren't joined (hopefully I'll figure that out in the future)</p> <hr>
		<h3>How long did it take?</h3>
		<p>I've never used blender, so that took more time than this image reflects. I spent a good portion of time watching videos on creating honey/syrup in blender, and that somehow ended in this snowman.</p>

		<h3>Caption</h3>
		<p> intended to make an animation of the bonk meme but importing into mesh editor did not work, so the first part is just the dog model that I made in the mesh editor program, which worked w/ subdividing. I did put an unhealthy amount of time into making this work but got blocked at the end :( so I just included what we'd intended to do, which was shade, rig, and animate the dog in Maya and convert that into fbx->.dae files for each individual frame. I streamed my process of that part here: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/970783616</p> <hr>
		<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
		<p>Modeled based off of UCBUGG's fox model lab in Maya, shaded in procreate and used renderman for the shaded render, rigged and animated in Maya.
		modeling: http://www.ucbugg.com/static/index.html#labsmodeling2
		rigging: based off all 3 of the rigging labs from UCBUGG</p> <hr>
