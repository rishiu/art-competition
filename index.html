		<h3>How is the artwork created?</h3>
		<p>We used the Project 3-2 depth of field section to create the individual frames with varying focus distances to show how it would look if you manually focused a camera. Then, we implemented bash scripting in Linux to programatically generate all the frames without needing to manually send render commands for each of them. Finally, we stitched all the resulting png images together using FFmpeg. If we had more time, we'd also try to use bash scripting to log in on the hive machinese and do the rendering there.</p> <hr>
		<h3>How long did it take?</h3>
		<p>7 including rendering</p>
